					My Little Shoebox, a designer brand in the US, was created in 2005 by Helen and Janice, two lifelong friends who share the same passion for arts and crafts. They loved to keep their handicraft and little treasures they had collected in a little shoebox when they were in high school. In 2006, they started a small studio and workshop in San Francisco, naming it My Little Shoebox to symbolize their sweet childhood memories and forever friendship.
